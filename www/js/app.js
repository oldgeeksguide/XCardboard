This app has been developed with the Intel XDK, AngularJS as well as Twitter bootstrap 3.  We wanted to develop cross platform application which is running on any modern Smartphone. Unfortunately, Google only offers apps for Android right now. Because we are so fascinated by the Google Cardboard, so we had the idea to develop an app for all platforms! This app is open source and is released and maintained on Github. ",
